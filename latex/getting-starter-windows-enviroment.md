# How to getting start your windows enviroment

Before start is necessary remember some concepts:

- MiKTeX (pronounced mick-tech) is an up-to-date implementation of TeX/LaTeX and related programs for Windows (all current variants) i.e. you must have this enviroment installed on your computer before anything. When you download/install MiKTeX you have a package manager for latex.

- Texmaker is a free, modern and cross-platform LaTeX editor for linux, macosx and windows systems that integrates many tools needed to develop documents with LaTeX, in just one application.

For this tutorial I will use Texmaker as a Editor but you can use another one.

1 - Download and install MiKTeX. (Next -> Next...)

2 - Download and install Texmaker. (Next -> Next...)

3 - Open your main .tex file.

4 - Go to "Options" and set main .tex file as a "master document". (With this you can compile your project from any other .tex file)

5 - Set "compile directives" to PDFLaTeX and See PDF
